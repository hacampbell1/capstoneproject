# Bank Account Fraud Machine Learning Capstone 

### Overview and Business Understanding

Proactive detection of bank account application fraud is always a priority item for clients in the financial and banking industries. Rapid technology advancements allows for additional detection and protection processes, but also means threat actors are becoming more complex in their attacks. Detecting these threat actors in a timely manner in hopes of preventing or reducing financial loss requires extensive time and effort. Advanced technology such as machine learning is not new, but increasing use cases and success allows for an expanded implementation scope. Machine learning models facilitate and expedite the detection process by identifying patterns of high risk account characteristics and features that are likely to be triggers of fraudulent activity. 

Clients who leverage machine learning models to detect fraudulent application patterns are more likely to reduce mean time to remediation by managing fraudulent event triggers before they are escalated to incidences. There is also increased chances of cost savings as less successful threat actors equates to less financial loss and resources spent in remediation and subsequent payout. Practices such as these increase success rates and demonstrate consistent results, efficiency, and service confidence in clients' customers. Finally, resources and manpower previously dedicated to tedious fraud detection monitoring and management can be better utilized to expand the organization and provide oppportunity and time to dedicate to other focus areas. 

Our team at Deloitte seeks to create and implement a state-of-the-art machine learning model for the purpose of filling these gaps for clients in relevant industries. Our aim is to help our clients understand driving predictors of bank account application fraud and implement industry leading and effective detection processes.
