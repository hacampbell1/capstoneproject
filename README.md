# Bank Account Fraud Machine Learning Capstone 

### Overview and Business Understanding

Proactive detection of bank account application fraud is always a priority item for clients in the financial and banking industries. Rapid technology advancements allows for additional detection and protection processes, but also means threat actors are becoming more complex in their attacks. Detecting these threat actors in a timely manner in hopes of preventing or reducing financial loss requires extensive time and effort. Advanced technology such as machine learning is not new, but expanding use cases and success allows for an expanded implementation scope. Machine learning models facilitate and expedite the detection process by identifying patterns of high risk account characteristics and features that are likely to be triggers of fraudulent activity. 

Clients who leverage machine learning models to detect fraudulent application patterns are more likely to reduce mean time to remediation by managing fraudulent event triggers before they are escalated to incidences. There is also increased chances of cost savings as less successful threat actors equates to less financial loss and resources spent in remediation and subsequent payout. Practices such as these increase success rates and demonstrate consistent results, efficiency, and service confidence in clients' customers. Finally, resources and manpower previously dedicated to tedious fraud detection monitoring and management can be better utilized to expand the organization and provide the oppportunity and time to dedicate to other focus areas. 

Our team at Deloitte seeks to create and implement a state-of-the-art machine learning model for the purpose of filling these gaps for clients in relevant industries. Our aim is to help our clients understand driving predictors of bank account application fraud and

How to prevent banking fraud
Follow the tips below to prevent bad actors from accessing digital banking information:

Brush up on your AI
Considering the volume of transfers most banks handle, it only makes sense that a machine reviews things and flags concerning transactions–a person wouldn’t be able to keep up. Make sure you’re using the best artificial intelligence you can afford.

Beware internal fraud
Clari5 reported that 65% to 70% of banking fraud happens because of internal fraud. Your own employees can all too easily sell customer information on the dark web. Make sure your internal sources are kept honest. That kind of trust is not easily earned back once lost.

Review transactions
Monitor how customers use their online accounts on a weekly basis for high-risk customers, and a monthly basis for lower-risk customers. This can help prevent money laundering. Take note of and report any suspicious activity. AI can be especially useful with recognizing suspicious patterns.

Educate your customers
One of the best ways to prevent account takeovers is customer education. Tell customers what kinds of risks they’re up against, what they should be looking out for, and how to safely interact with their online banking system.
Make them aware of what kinds of phishing emails they’ll encounter. Alert them to what information a bank should or should not ask for over text message, and from whom the message should be sent. Another great tip for customers is to instruct them that, when in doubt, call your bank directly to clarify.
